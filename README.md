## Smart Parking System

This project implements a car parking detection system using the R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model. It aims to accurately detect cars in parking spaces under different weather conditions, including sunny, rainy, and overcast.

### Libraries Used

* **OpenCV (CV):** Primary library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
* **(Other Libraries):** Specify the additional libraries used for data preprocessing and filtering (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-image).

### Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of detecting cars in parking scenarios under varying weather conditions. 

* **Model:** R-CNN is employed for object detection, specifically trained to identify cars in images.
* **Data:** The dataset likely consists of images or videos captured under different weather conditions (sunny, rainy, overcast). 
* **Preprocessing:** Images might undergo various preprocessing steps  (e.g., resizing, normalization) to improve model performance.
* **Filtering:** Techniques (e.g., background subtraction, noise reduction) can be applied to enhance car detection accuracy.

### Running the Project

1. **Installation:** Install the required libraries (OpenCV, others) using package managers like pip.
2. **Data Preparation:** Ensure your dataset is properly structured and accessible to the code.
3. **Model Training (Optional):** If the R-CNN model is not pre-trained, training scripts might be included to train the model on your dataset.
4. **Execution:** Run the main script (`main.py`, or similar) to process the images/videos and visualize the car detection results.

**Note:** Modify the instructions based on your specific project structure and execution steps.

### Expected Output

The project should output images or video frames with bounding boxes around detected cars. Additionally, it might  display information such as the number of available parking spaces or occupancy status.


### Addressing Weather Conditions

This section can discuss how your approach handles the variations in weather conditions:

* **Data Augmentation:** Briefly mention if data augmentation techniques were used to increase the diversity of training data and improve robustness to weather changes.
* **Filtering Techniques:** Explain how filtering techniques address challenges specific to rain (e.g., removing water streaks) or overcast conditions (e.g., adjusting contrast).


### Further Improvements

This section can outline potential areas for future development:

* **Model Optimization:** Discuss potential strategies to optimize the R-CNN model for faster processing or better accuracy.
* **Real-time Processing:** Explore strategies for implementing real-time car detection in a live video feed.
* **Integration with Parking Management Systems:** Discuss potential integration with existing parking management systems for real-world applications.
